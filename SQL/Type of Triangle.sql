Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.

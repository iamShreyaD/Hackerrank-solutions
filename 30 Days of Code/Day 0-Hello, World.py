Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

You've got this!

Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the  variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

inputString = input() # get a line of input from stdin and save it to our variable

# Your first line of output goes here
print('Hello, World.')

# Write the second line of output
print(inputString)
